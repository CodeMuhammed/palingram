For single page applications, where the html markup is just a template that will hold data that is being dynamically generated and complied on the client side, it becomes really difficult or impossible for search engines to crawl and search these contents without a little bit of effort being put into the crawling process by the web master.</p><h3>The focus will be on AngularJS, <br></h3><p>a powerful client side javascript framework for building single page applications hopefully these sets of tricks will apply to other SPA's (single page application).<br></p><p>Since data is mainly served over xhr to populate the templates, AngularJS uses a front end routing system to enable navigation from one page to another which introduces a subtle but significant difference from RTA's (round trip applications) - the # or hash fragment in routes. <br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, whenever a link is clicked or navigated to another page in RTA, the server serves everything from scratch but in SPA. that action will mean restarting the whole application all over again which is not an effect that a user will appreciate, So everything after the # is what tell angularJS how to recreate the content automatically when the user refreshes the page.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As it&nbsp; turns out, google does not understand the # in urls and truncates everything after it&nbsp; and crawls the remaining section of a link provided to it. for instance if&nbsp; an application contains routes that are in the formats.</p><p>www.example.com#homepage</p><p>www.example.com#pageone</p><p>www.example.com#pagetwo</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked to be crawled by googe, it removes the # part of the urls leaving three www.example.com routes which it then crawls. Given that angularJS applications are template based , there is every tendency that the contents will not be seen by the search engines thus leaving the application in darkness.</p><blockquote><p>As it turns out, Ajax applications and ultimately single page applications can be crawled almost as easily as non-ajax websites</p></blockquote><p>In part two of this series, we will be looking at the&nbsp; various steps that can be taken to make you beloved SPA framework conform to search engine terms.</p><p>please recommend and share this article to your friends and colleagues.<br></p>","comments_id":"55ce6c8c00a6ab841d4fdd04","tags":["angularjs","tutorial","seo"],"bio":"<p>I love blogging on&nbsp; <b>palingram</b><br></p>","views":6}]
